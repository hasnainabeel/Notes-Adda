# Your search for notes has now become easy. A one stop site for all your exam needs.
(I have not implemented the responsiveness for small screens. So anyone can contribute to the project.)

## Important Note

#### Before contributing Do this 
- The website gets redirected to a URL
- So comment this line of code in index.html â†“
- ``` <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "2; url = https://hasnainabeel.github.io/Notes-Point" />```
- Then start contributing.
- And also uncomment it in the end.
